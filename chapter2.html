            <article>
                <p>She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed, she might have been hurt.</p>
                <p>The cyclone had set the house down very gently in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of greensward, stately trees, and banks of gorgeous flowers.</p>
                <p>While she stood looking eagerly, a group of the queerest people she had ever seen came toward her. They paused, and the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow, and said, "You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins."</p>
                <p>Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. "Your house did, anyway," the old woman replied with a laugh, pointing to the corner where two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes.</p>
                <p>The little old woman continued, "You must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you."</p>
                <p>With a kiss from the Witch of the North and a round, shining mark on her forehead, Dorothy began her journey down the Yellow Brick Road.</p>
