                <p>When Dorothy was left alone, she began to feel hungry. She went to the brook, filled her pail with water, and found delicious fruit to eat.</p>
                <p>She dressed herself in a clean gingham dress, took the silver shoes, and set off down the Yellow Brick Road with Toto. The country was beautiful, with blue-painted fences and round houses.</p>
                <p>Toward evening, she came to a house where people danced and celebrated their freedom. Dorothy stayed the night with Boq, a wealthy Munchkin.</p>
                <p>The next day, as she walked along, she noticed a Scarecrow and was startled when it winked at her. She helped it down from its pole, and the Scarecrow thanked her. "I have no brains," it explained, "but if I come with you to Oz, perhaps he will give me some."</p>
                <p>So the two continued their journey together, with Toto sniffing curiously at the new companion. The Scarecrow revealed that the only thing it feared was a lighted match.</p>
