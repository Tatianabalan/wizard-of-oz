            <article>
                <p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles.</p>
                <p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.</p>
                <p>Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms and looked at the sky too.</p>
                <p>"There's a cyclone coming, Em," Uncle Henry called to his wife. "I'll go look after the stock."</p>
                <p>Suddenly, there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing. Then a strange thing happened. The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air.</p>
                <p>Hour after hour passed away, and Dorothy slowly got over her fright. At last, she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it. In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.</p>
